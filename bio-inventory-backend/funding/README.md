## Configuration

### Django Settings
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps
    'funding',
]
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations funding
python manage.py migrate
```

### URL Configuration
```python
# core/urls.py
path('api/', include('funding.urls')),
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Fund
```python
Fund.objects.create(
    name='NSF Grant 2024',
    total_budget=100000.00,
    funding_source='National Science Foundation',
    created_by=user
)
```

### Recording a Transaction
```python
Transaction.objects.create(
    fund=fund,
    amount=2500.00,
    transaction_type='purchase',
    item_name='PCR Machine',
    created_by=user
)
```

### Getting Fund Recommendations
```python
from funding.utils import generate_fund_recommendations
recommendations = generate_fund_recommendations(fund)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check fund health scores regularly
2. **Timely Allocation**: Set up budget allocations early in grant period
3. **Category Consistency**: Use consistent naming for automatic categorization
4. **Regular Backups**: Export financial data regularly for compliance
5. **Access Control**: Limit fund management to authorized personnel
